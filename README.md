# mern-stack-from-scratch

This repository is designed for beginners to learn the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) step by step.  
It includes daily practice files for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and eventually full-stack projects.

## Folder Structure

- `Mern/`  
  Contains HTML practice files and images:
  - `forms.html` – HTML form elements practice  
  - `table.html` – Table creation practice  
  - `OIP.webp` – Sample image used in practice

## How to Use

1. Open the files in your browser to see HTML elements in action.  
2. Practice by editing existing files or adding new files in the `Mern/` folder.  
3. Commit your changes daily with clear messages like:  
   `day 2: practiced HTML lists`

## Future Plan

- Add CSS practice files  
- Add JavaScript practice files  
- Gradually build full MERN projects  
- Organize files day-wise for easier tracking

## Notes

- Main branch is always safe; daily practice files can be pushed directly.  
- Pull Requests are optional for personal practice; use them when working on final projects.
